## Introduction 
##
## ________________________________________________________________________________
##
##
## This case study examines player and team performance in the 2020 Super Netball season, focusing on key performance indicators that coaches can use to enhance their decision making. After some investigation I found the key analytcial areas that Netball Coaches wish to know about include:
##
## - Top Performers (Player & Team)
## - Scoring efficiency
## - Turnovers & possession control
## - Defensive strength
## - Midcourt performance
## - Discipline (penalties & fouls)
##
## ________________________________________________________________________________
```{r}
# Load up the data set 
SuperNetball_data <- read_csv("Dataset3_Assessment3.csv", show_col_types = FALSE)

# Convert both 'Athlete' and 'Team' to categorical variables this allows my R analysis to become more efficient, accurate, and visually clear.  It correctly groups data to assist in visualisations.
SuperNetball_data <- SuperNetball_data %>%
  mutate(Athlete = as.factor(Athlete),
         Team = as.factor(Team),
         Statistic = as.factor(Statistic))

# Create Team Performance data set 
team_performance <- SuperNetball_data %>%
  group_by(Team) %>%
  summarise(Total_Performance = sum(Total, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  arrange(desc(Total_Performance))

# Ensure no duplicate rows
SuperNetball_data <- distinct(SuperNetball_data)
```

## 1. Boxplot representing 'Statisical Distribution of the Super Netball data' 
## ________________________________________________________________________________##
##
##
## Creation of a boxplot to view the statistical distribution of the varying statistics.
## The wider the spread indicates the variation in player performance. 
## Any outliers indicate the exceptional or in some instances underperforming players.
## Colourblind friendly colours are utilised for ease of viewing.
## The plot helps the coach to understand the distribution of player performance.
## Its helps with the following coach decisions
##
## - Player development - which may address
## - Game strategy 
## - Recruitment of players

## per Netball - Top 10 Shooters by Accuracy - Efficiency and Accuracy Analysis

## Who Are the Most Accurate Shooters? Players with high accuracy but fewer attempts may need more game time. Long-range shooters (high zone 2 accuracy) are valuable for difficult shots. Looking at Shooting Efficiency and Accuracy. 
## Coaches would use this information to identify the most efficient and accurate shooters which may be used for Scouting or Recruitment purposes. Now we will look at statistics including goals and attempts from Zone 1 and Zone 2 .  
## This will show us who us efficient vs volume shooters. 
##It will also distinguish between close range and long range threats and enable accurate calculation of shooting percentages. 
## This may help the coach design better offensive strategies and is clearly helpful for scouting, recrutiment and player development.

## - In terms of recruitment, the data can be used to identify top shooters
## - In terms of scouting, the data can be used to identify the top shooters and or exploit the weaker ones.

## Possession of the Netball is the key to the sport and key defenders are paramount to the teams success by gaining possession.  Coaches want to see their teams with the Netball so crucial area for coaches

## Which Teams Get the Most Penalties? Frequent penalties disrupt game flow & impact team success. Contact & obstruction penalties are the most common. Teams with high fouls may need defensive strategy changes.
## 5. Discipline - Find a way to display discipline related penalities and fouls
## Create a whisker plot which will show variation in penalty counts and help to identify which penalty types are high or vary. It show outliers and highlights players that commit unusally high number of specific foul.
## This shows contact and obstruction have higher median, meaning more frequent of the penalitie.  Can allow coaches to focus on specific infractions and discipline areas
